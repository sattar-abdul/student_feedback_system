# student_feedback_system


INTRODUCTION
The "Student Feedback System" facilitates a seamless feedback mechanism that enables students to
share their insights on the teaching methodologies, course content, and overall professorship.
Professors, in turn, gain valuable insights into their performance and receive constructive feedback to
enhance the quality of education provided.

Methodology
The development and implementation of the "Student Feedback System" follow a systematic and
structured methodology, ensuring the creation of a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application. The
methodology encompasses the following key phases:

1. Requirement Analysis:
In this initial phase, a comprehensive analysis of the project requirements is conducted. Discussions
are held to identify and document, the specific needs and expectations of students, professors, and
administrators. The key functionalities, user roles, and system features are defined.

2. System Design:
Once the requirements are clear, the system design phase commences. This involves creating detailed
architectural diagrams, database schemas, and wireframes. The design considers the user interface,
system components, and the integration of backend technologies. Decision-making on the choice of
frameworks, libraries, and databases is made during this phase.

3. Database Implementation:
The MySQL database is implemented based on the designed schema. This includes creating tables for
students, professors, feedback responses, and other relevant entities. Relationships between tables are
established, and data integrity measures are put in place.

4. Backend Development:
The backend development involves coding the server-side logic using Flask, a Python web framework. This includes creating routes, handling HTTP requests and responses, implementing user authentication, and integrating the application with the MySQL database. Flask extensions such as SQLAlchemy is utilized for efficient database operations.

5. Frontend Development:
The frontend development focuses on creating responsive user interface. HTML, CSS are used to build dynamic web pages. Templates are designed for login pages, feedback forms, and data presentation
